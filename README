TTRP Movement Calculator

A script to keep track of where TTRP entities (players, enemies, etc.)
are on the board. Given an entity's stats, it will restrict you based
on movement speed and how many "movements" can be made on a turn.

Input (Planned)

1) Board Size
    Tell the script how large the board is so that it knows what to
    keep track of. You can also add details like the size of a
    single space (2D or 3D).

2) Add Entity Profiles
    Can create them in the script, or save them to load later.


Functionality (Planned)

1) Choose an entity and where to move it (You can enforce game rules,
or disable them to place an entity anywhere on the board).

2) Undo a previous move.

3) Add or remove an entity at any time.

UI (Planned)

1 Create a window that displays entities at their recorded locations
